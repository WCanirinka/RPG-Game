# JavaScript Capstone Project: Build an RPG game

# AFRICAN JUNGLE ![screenshot](../assets/board/Axes.png)

This is Microverse's final project for the Javascript section.

In this project I implemented an RPG game using [Phaser 3](http://phaser.io/tutorials), an open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games.

## About

This project's objective was to build a platform game similar [GameDev Academy](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/).The main objective was to use the tutorial to point me in the right direction to build a platform game with different levels.

## The game

It is a turn-based game where you will have three characters, the game start with the first character (prospector) , you will be using him to find the enemies **spolier alert!!! enemies are not visible use brute force to see them** when you find the enemies you will have your two other characters **Herus** and **ninja** to help you fighting the enemies. select the character you want to use with **keyboard arrows** and attack the enemy with **space**. the game has three levels and as you
progress you get stronger enemies and higher score.
###### 0- 50 level 1
###### 50- 200 level 2
###### 200- ++ level 3
on the left, of the screen, you can see the LeaderBoard and when the game end if you broke your record, it will be automatically updated on the LeaderBoard

when you  are in the battle screen you will see your two heroes characters appear on the right and the enemies on the left of the screen, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to select your hero and press space to attack after you've attacked the enemies will automatically attack you, you can keep track of your remaining hp by looking at the health bar on the top left of your screen.if you won the battle you will be taken back to the main screen so that you can look for more enemies if you lost you will be taken to the game over screen.
